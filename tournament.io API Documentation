Tournament.app Public API
 The document and the API is still work in progress. It only works with Version 3 of Kickertool.
Welcome to the Tournament.app Public API documentation. This API allows you to access tournament data from our platform, enabling you to integrate Tournament.app functionality into your own applications or services.

Introduction
The Tournament.app Public API provides programmatic access to tournament information, including tournament details, courts, and matches. This API is designed for end-users who want to retrieve data from tournaments they have created or have access to on the Tournament.app platform.

Supported Apps
Currently this API is only supported by the Kickertool V3 Alpha: https://alpha.kickertool.de

Tournament Structure
The tournament object is structured hierarchically to accommodate various competition formats and complexities. Here's a breakdown of its main components:

Disciplines
Disciplines represent different categories or events within a tournament. Examples include:

Open Singles
Open Doubles
Men's Doubles
Women's Singles
…
EntryType
The entryType defines what type of participants are playing in a discipline.

EntryType	Description
single	Represents individual participants. Each entry is a single player competing on their own.
team_name	Represents named teams. Entries are teams with specific names. No players are assigned.
dyp	Stands for "Draw Your Partner". In this format, players are paired before the tournament starts. During the tournament, the teams are fixed.
byp	Stands for "Bring Your Partner". Players enter the tournament with a chosen partner, forming a fixed team throughout the event.
monster_dyp	Individual players participate and are assigned to new teams every round.
Stages
Stages represent distinct phases of a tournament within a discipline. Common stages include:

Preliminary Round
Elimination Round
Valid states
StageState	Description
planned	The stage is set up but not yet ready to begin. It may still be in the configuration or preparation phase.
ready	The stage is fully configured and ready to start. All necessary preparations are complete, but matches haven't begun.
running	The stage is currently active. Matches are being played or are scheduled to be played in this stage.
finished	All matches in the stage have been completed. The stage is no longer active and its results are final.
Groups
Groups are the fundamental units of competition within a stage. Every stage has at least one group, but can have multiple depending on the tournament format:

In a round-robin format (like the soccer World Cup), a stage might have multiple groups where teams play against others in their group.
In elimination formats, multiple groups can represent different elimination trees
Groups define the tournament mode, such as Swiss system, round-robin, or single elimination. They contain the matches and standings for that part of the competition. The states are the same as the states in the stage.

Currently following tournament modes are implemented:

double_elimination
elimination
last_one_standing
lord_have_mercy
monster_dyp
round_robin
rounds
snake_draw
swiss
dutch_system
whist
Group Options
Group options define specific settings and rules for how matches are conducted within a group:

Match Configurations
Match configurations set the rules for how games are played and scored.

Option	Description
name	The name of the match configuration (e.g., "Encounter 1", "Team 1 vs Team 1", "Single") is chosen by the Tournament Admin and should only be displayed if more than one configuration is set up.
draw	Boolean indicating whether matches can end in a draw
numPoints	Number of points needed to win a set
numSets	Number of won sets needed to win the match
twoAhead	Boolean indicating whether a player must win by two points
quickEntry	Boolean enabling simplified score entry mode, in this case scores a either 1 or 0
Additional Settings
Some tournament modes have specific options:

Option	Description
eliminationThirdPlace	Boolean indicating whether a third-place match will be played in elimination formats

Matches
GET
/tournaments/:id/matches/:matchId
https://api.tournament.io/v1/public/tournaments/:id/matches/:matchId
This endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific match within a tournament. This endpoint is useful for getting up-to-date data on match status, scores, and participating players or teams.

entries
The structure of the entries field can vary depending on the type of tournament running.

 All teams or players can be `null`. For example, if a team in an elimination round has not yet been assigned, it will be indicated as `null`.
Singles Tournament
For a Singles tournament it would appear as follows:

"entries": [
  {
    "id": "05-2553",
    "name": "Helmut Poppen"
  },
  {
    "id": "05-4357",
    "name": "Sophia Poppen"
  }
],
Fixed Teams tournament
For a structiure for a fixed team tournament looks quite similar:

"entries": [
{
    "id": "05-2553_05-4357",
    "name": "Helmut Poppen / Sophia Poppen"
  },
  {
    "id": "05-9012_05-9876",
    "name": "Caroline Conrad / Andrei Andros"
  }
],
Variable Teams Tournament
For a MonsterDYP or Last One Standing tournament, the players of a team are wrapped in an seperate array:

"entries": [
  [
    {
      "id": "05-2553",
      "name": "Helmut Poppen"
    },
    {
      "id": "05-4357",
      "name": "Sophia Poppen"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "id": "05-9012",
      "name": "Caroline Conrad"
    },
    {
      "id": "05-9876",
      "name": "Andrei Andros"
    }
  ],
],
 There are tournament modes that support more than 2 players per team.
 The team may be set to `null`, and there are even cases where a single player in a team is set to `null`. This occurs when the "Lord Have Mercy" system is enabled during an elimination.
Valid state values:
open: Match is waiting to be announced
paused: Match is disabled (on pause)
skipped: Match is skipped (e.g. Entry left tournament)
running: Match is running
played: Match is finished / played
planned: Match is planned / awaiting announcement
incomplete: Match is waiting for entries to be assigned
bye: Match is a bye (e.g. in elimination stage)
encounters / score
The encounters array stores the detailed result of the match. It consists of 3 nested arrays:

1) Encounters: For league modes like Single/Double/Single every entry represents an encounter
   2) Sets: This is an array of winning sets
      3) Score: The actual result of an match is stored here
 If a result is set, there will be a `displayScore` property that contains the calculated score.
Simple Example: just one set

"encounters": [
  [
    [7, 5]
  ]
],
"displayScore": [7, 5],
More complex: Best of 3

"encounters": [
  [
    [7, 5],
    [6, 7],
    [2, 7]
  ]
],
"displayScore": [1, 3]
Max. Complexity: 3 Encounters - Best of 3, Best of one, Best of 5

"encounters": [
  [
    [7, 5],
    [6, 7],
    [2, 7]
  ],
    [2, 7]
  ],
    [
    [6, 7],
    [7, 5],
    [2, 7],
    [7, 5],
    [2, 7],
  ],
],
"displayScore": [0, 3]
 If "Quick Entry" for results is selected, scores are represented as `1` or `0`.

PUT
/tournaments/:id/matches/:matchId/result
https://api.tournament.io/v1/public/tournaments/:id/matches/:matchId/result
This endpoint allows you to set the result of a running match within a tournament.

 Only matches in the state `running` can be updated. If the match has a different state, a 412 status is returned.
Body
The request body should contain a `result` field with the new match result:

{
  "result": [[[1, 7]]]
}
The result field follows the structure of the encounters array described in the match details:

Outermost array: Encounters (for league modes like Single/Double/Single)
Middle array: Sets within each encounter
Innermost array: Actual scores for each set
On successful update (status code 200), the response will contain the updated match object. This object follows the same structure as described in the Get Match Details endpoint.

Webhooks
Webhooks offer a powerful way to receive real-time updates from Tournament.app about specific events in your tournaments. Instead of constantly polling our API for changes, webhooks allow our system to push information to your application as events occur.

To use this feature, you must provide a POST endpoint in your application that we can call when specific changes happen in the tournament.

INFO
Create Webhooks
No URL, Just Documentation
To use the API and set up webhooks, you'll need to generate an API token and configure your webhook endpoints. Follow these steps:

Log in to your Tournament.app account
Click on your profile picture in the bottom left corner
Navigate to "Settings"
Select the "API" section
Click on "Create Webhook"
Example request:

Webhook Events
No URL, Just Documentation
Each webhook call is structured as a WebhookCallDto, containing a unique, incrementing ID, the tournament ID, and an array of events.

Webhook Synchronization
Tournament.app supports offline functionality, which can affect webhook event delivery:

When devices are offline, changes are stored locally.
Upon reconnection, all accumulated changes are synced to the server.
These synced changes are then sent as events to your webhook endpoint.
Each event includes a createdAt timestamp, reflecting when the change was made on the user's device.
This approach ensures that no updates are lost, even during periods of disconnection. However, be aware that you may receive multiple events simultaneously when a device comes back online after an extended offline period.

Webhook Call Structure
Each webhook call will have this structure:

{
  "id": 1234,
  "tournamentId": "tio:T5MMiW8IVuWMp",
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "MatchUpdated",
      "matchId": "tio:uVOK5NQ5ruqqm",
      "createdAt": "2024-08-28T15:12:30.413Z"
    },
    {
      "type": "StandingsUpdated",

Error Handling
No URL, Just Documentation
Tournament.app implements a robust error handling and retry mechanism for webhook deliveries:

Retry Mechanism
If your webhook endpoint responds with a non-2xx status code, Tournament.app considers it a failed delivery.
The system will attempt to resend the events up to 5 times.
Each retry follows an exponential backoff strategy, increasing the time between attempts.
Webhook Disabling
After 5 consecutive failed attempts, the webhook will be automatically disabled.
This prevents unnecessary network traffic and reduces system load.
Re-enabling a Disabled Webhook
To re-enable a disabled webhook:

Navigate to the webhook list in your Tournament.app settings.
Locate the disabled webhook (it will be marked as such).
Click the play button next to the disabled webhook to re-enable it.
Debugging
The webhook list in Tournament.app provides access to log messages for each webhook. These logs are available for debugging purposes can hopepfully assist in identifying and resolving issues with your webhook endpoint.
